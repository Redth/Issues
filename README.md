Severity:
- critical: must be resolved immediately, as it renders the app unusable until it is resolved.
- high: must be resolved at the earliest, as it degrades user experience and there is no workaround.
- medium: can be fixed in the normal course of development and testing.
- low:  can be fixed at a later date (more serious bugs take priority).
